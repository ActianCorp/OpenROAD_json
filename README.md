Assumptions:

* OpenROAD is installed with JSON RPC Support.
* jsonrpcservertest is registered with sample jsonrpcservertest.img in Visual OpenROAD Server Administrator. Many of these examples make use of the `subtract()` procedure, the 4gl source for which can be found in `%II_SYSTEM%\ingres\files\orjsonsamples\jsonrpcservertest.xml`
* Tomcat is installed. Tomcat 9 was used in the creation of these demos.
* openroad.jar is in `{Tomcat installation folder}\lib`, for example - `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9\lib`
* Gatekeeper3 folder contents is in `openroad` webapp, i.e. `{Tomcat installation folder}\webapps\openroad`
* `HOSTNAME` is a Full Computer Name/IP where `openroad` webapp is deployed, for example - *localhost*.
* `PORT` is a connection port number for your web server, for example - default port for Tomcat is *8080*
* `PROTOCOL` is the web protocol used, for example - http or https
* Open `PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME:PORT/openroad/jsonrpc?app=jsonrpcservertest` in your browser to confirm the server is ready

Note: Refer to **Server Reference Guide** for more details. The openroad.jar and Gatekeeper3 folder is available under orjava folder in your OpenROAD installation, that is, `%II_SYSTEM%\ingres\orjava`

## Existing comtest application

* `comtest.json` configuration file, which contains existing comtest application proceduresâ€™ registration entries, is provided under `%II_SYSTEM%\ingres\files\orjsonconfig`.
* You can test comtest JSON-RPC Endpoint by opening `PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME:PORT/openroad/jsonrpc?app=comtest` in your browser.
* You can find comtest helloworld examples under curl and html directories.

## ORJSON_URL Environment Variable

To override URL, set operating system environment variable `ORJSON_URL` for example:

#### Windows

    set ORJSON_URL=PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME:PORT/openroad

#### Unix / Linux:

    export ORJSON_URL=PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME:PORT/openroad

Note: If `ORJSON_URL` environment variable is not set, then default localhost URL `http://localhost:8080/openroad/jsonrpc?app=jsonrpcservertest` is used. `ORJSON_URL` have no impact on HTML demos.
